# ElevDB

This is for a school project, or rather apprenticeship exam (Svendepr√∏ve in the local language). It's an attempt to include to subjects, programming and database design, in a minor way.
The education itself is more operations focused.

The project also doubles as a way for me to get to know the blazor pages a bit.

## What it does
It allows for the creation of students and saving them into an SQL database. There's also staff which can log in with username and password stored in SQL, not ideal but the database inclusion is pretty important.

Hopefully someone in a similar situation to mine comes across this and finds inspiration, for a simple site with SQL integration.
